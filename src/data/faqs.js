          "faq_question": "The difference between a Modern CV and an ATS Compliant CV?",
          "faq_answer": "A modern CV is focused on showcasing the candidate's skills, qualifications, and experience in a visually appealing and easy-to-read format. It may include elements such as infographics, charts, and graphics to  help make the CV stand out. An ATS-compliant CV, on the other hand, is designed to be read by an Applicant Tracking System (ATS). Many companies use these systems to screen resumes before they are ever seen by a human hiring manager. These systems are designed to scan resumes for keywords and qualifications, so an ATScompliant CV must be formatted in a way that makes it easy for the system to read and understand."
